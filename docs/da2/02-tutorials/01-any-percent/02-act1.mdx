At the top of the stairs, hug the south side wall.
Turn the camera south-west, while every character is selected right click the top of the stairs you
see to the west.
As all the characters begin moving, you walk back to the gate and position yourself in the south 
corner where the iron gate meets the wall.
When the other characters have reached their destination, they will teleport back to you. One of them should be on the other side of the gate.
Select the gate character and move them south in the Qunari Compound, up the middle of the stairs.
Swap back to Hawke.
Walk south and meet the gate character on the other side of the wall. Make a quicksave here.
Walk south to the leave area trigger. Pause the game.
Swap back to the gate character, right click to move them up to the throne to the east.
Swap back to Hawke and unpause the game.
Pause the game when you see the gate characters dot just pass through the middle of the X on the minimap. 
 
Interact with the Leave Area trigger, unpause the game. If you timed it just right, you should get the dialogue with the Arishok now. Otherwise we’ll keep buffering.
Press ESC and Pause in quick succession, so that you’re paused when you leave the map. Interact with the Leave Area trigger again, and keep repeating this until you get the dialogue.
When you get the dialogue:
Spam ESC and 1 for both the first and second dialogue options. After that, spam ESC until you get the 3rd dialogue option. Press 1 and press ESC 8 times. Once you see the Arishok standing with Hawke in the foreground, the next ESC will bring up the map.
Travel to the Gallows (Day).
Note: If you didn’t get the map screen, but finished the dialogue you’re softlocked. Simply reload the quicksave and try again.

[Second explanation video here]

Alternate way to clip through the gate:
	Note: This is more RNG heavy, potentially faster but usually not worth it.
	Have Hawke in the south corner where the gate meets the wall.
	On another character, right click the “Gather Your Party” object just down the stairs.
	Swap back to Hawke and wait for the screen to pop up.
	Click Confirm, if you’re lucky one of the characters got placed on the other side of the gate.

## The Deep Roads Expedition

Follow the path through the Deep Roads. This map is very straightforward with little to no deviations. Avoid fights, just run straight.

After you encounter Sandal, check both Hawke and Varric’s HP. Drink a Health Potion if either are below 50% health. Select your party and have them follow you through the rest of the dungeon.

Continue forwards until you encounter a closed door leading towards a square room. This is where The Ogre fight is. He will be in the bottom left corner of the room. Right click to ensure Varric follows you inside. Use Cleave twice and cast Winter’s Grasp on the Ogre until it dies. Afterwards, use Cone of Cold on the enemies who have been bottlenecked at the entrance. Remove hold position on Varric. 

As you approach the final room in this section of the Deep Roads, there is a trigger for the Dragon fight that can be avoided. Hold position with Varric and hug the left wall before the final pair of pillars at the end of the hallway to avoid setting off the trigger. Select Varric and repeat the process, completely skipping the Dragon fight. Exit to Primeval Ruins as Varric.


## Primeval Ruins

Follow the path as Varric, and hug the left side of the stone stairs going down. This puts Bartrand in a nice position for a conversation glitch if you want to do that. Swap to Hawke after the conversation, then Cleave twice, place down Tempest on the Golem, on the stairs far in front of you, and the stairs just behind you. Spam Bolster until the Golem is alive, then kill it with Winter’s Grasp.
Enter Primeval Thaig.


Depending on Bartrands position, it’s possible to do a conversation glitch with him through to the next area, but it’s only worth going for once. Same concept as the one in the Hanged Man. Look at these videos for more info: https://youtu.be/rZp3TNpqdYk & https://youtu.be/8NCDjMx9mfU


## Primeval Thaig

Continue following the path through the Thaig. Like The Deep Roads, there are little to no deviations and any side chambers contain unnecessary pickups. At the circular/donut room, take the left hand path.
After you get the cutscene with the Stone Wraith boss, Cleave until you’ve depleted half your stamina bar, then spam Winter’s Grasp on it. You should be able to take down about half its health.
Hide behind a pillar until it’s done doing its blast, while keeping up your Cleave, and finish it off with Winter’s Grasp.
Loot the Crypt Treasure and return to the surface.
