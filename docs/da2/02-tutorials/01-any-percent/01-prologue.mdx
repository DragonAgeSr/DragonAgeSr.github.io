## Tutorial

Class is Rogue. Gender doesn’t matter.
Timer starts when you click “Confirm” on class selection.
Skip through the starting cutscenes, and you’ll start off in the first wave of the tutorial fight. Quick note: You can’t die here, so don’t worry about your health. 

#### Wave 1
To the far right there are two Hurlock Bolters (archers), target them first. Use the [Target closest and attack keybind](/docs/da2/welcome/basic-setup#:~:text=Target%20closest%20and%20attack) to do your auto attacks. Turn around and use the <Ability game="DA2" name="Rush"/> ability (Quickslot 6) on the enemies that are grouped together behind you and make your way back to Bethany. Kill the enemy closest to her and the single Hurlock that spawns from the middle. More Hurlocks will spawn in the distance to the left. Target them, and if they are grouped together nicely a <Ability game="DA2" name="Rush"/> attack will finish them off.

#### Wave 2
Wave two involves more improvisation, but generally you would want to take out the Hurlock Bolter that spawns in the center first. Bethany will shoot a fireball to the group that spawns on the left, so make your way over there and use <Ability game="DA2" name="Rush"/> to take out as many enemies as you can. Generally stay in this area to have the Hurlocks congregate around you, so you can maneuver them into groups and kill them with <Ability game="DA2" name="Rush"/>. Once you only have a couple of enemies left you can move towards Bethany and finish off the rest of the wave.

#### Wave 3
For Wave three, ignore the surrounding Hurlocks and focus solely on the Ogre. You want to start the battle with <Ability game="DA2" name="Rush"/>. From there, cycle through <Ability game="DA2" name="Backstab"/> (Quickslot 1), <Ability game="DA2" name="Explosive Strike"/> (Quickslot 4) and <Ability game="DA2" name="Rush"/> until it dies. Skip through the cutscenes, in the character customization screen, press start game and set the difficulty to Casual.
