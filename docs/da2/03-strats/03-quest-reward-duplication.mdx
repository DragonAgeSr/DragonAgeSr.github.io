Video: (insert link) \
Before talking to an NPC to complete their quest\
Move all characters close to NPC\
Pause game and interact with the NPC with each of your party members\
Unpause the game. The cutscene will play the dialogue as many times as you have party members\
You get a reward per party member (For example: If a quest gives 2 gold and 200 XP as a reward, you get a total of 8 gold and 800 XP if you interact with a full party of four.)
