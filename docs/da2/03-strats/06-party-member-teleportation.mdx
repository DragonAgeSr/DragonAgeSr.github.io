# Party Member Teleportation Glitch

Video: (insert link) \
When you use Hold Position on your party members, there is a maximum distance you can move away from them before they will begin to follow you again. They have a greater range outside of that where they will teleport back to you. Right click a space on the ground as far away as possible with one or more party members, and swap back to the character you want them to teleport to. If they are outside the max range, they will teleport back to you once they have reached their destination. You can use this to get past obstacles such as invisible walls or gates.
