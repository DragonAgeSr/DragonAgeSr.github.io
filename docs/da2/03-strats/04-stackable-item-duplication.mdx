# Stackable Item Duplication

Video: (insert link) \
This is the old way to get the gold required for the run. It’s not currently used in the run, but it’s worth keeping in mind as a backup if you’re short on gold. This works with any stackable item, as long as you have at least 3 of them. 

Enter any store where you can sell items, and navigate to the tab that has the item you’re interested in duplicating. Make sure there’s 1 of this item on the buying side, and 2 on the selling side with the same price. On the selling side, you will double click the item you’re interested in, and as you finish your second click you will click CTRL. The popup window item icon should turn blank. You can then click sell twice, and you should see the item count on the buying side double. Buy back the items and make sure you leave 1 on the buying side. Repeat the process as necessary.
