Move spell to desired hotbar key (1, 2, 5 etc)\
Drag spell off hotbar. While still holding the spell, swap to Hawke using F1\
Spell should now be on Hawkeâ€™s hotbar with no cooldown\
The hotbar key on Hawke needs to be empty for it to be moved over.\
This can be done on both the ability screen and in regular gameplay.
