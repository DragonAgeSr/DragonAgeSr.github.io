# Movement

## LMB + RMB = Walk

This is the same as if you held W. This makes it very easy to reach buttons with your other hand while moving forward, for example when swapping characters.

## Combat State

Whenever you’re in combat stance, you walk up stairs and slopes faster. A consistent way to enter the combat stance without nearby enemies is by right clicking something that’s interactable, i.e. a party member portrait in the bottom left side of the screen, a door or a chest etc.
