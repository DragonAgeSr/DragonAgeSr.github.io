# Conversation Glitch

Video: (insert link) \
Trigger a conversation with an NPC on the wrong map. This is a very precise glitch, and is easier to perform on lower FPS (about 30-60 depending on device specs). Find an NPC that is within party member distance (within a distance where your party members will stay still and not follow you) of an area exit. Hold positions with your party members. Move one by the exit and one by the desired NPC. Quick save with the character closest to the exit for safety. In quick succession: right click the exit. Pause the game. Swap to the character close to the NPC. Unpause the game and right click the NPC. If done correctly, you will notice an abnormally long loading screen, followed by the NPC dialogue on the wrong map.
