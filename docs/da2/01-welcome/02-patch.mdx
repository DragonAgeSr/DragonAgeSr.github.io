# Patch

The speedruns for DA2 uses __patch 1.00__. You can find the downpather HERE (insert link).

The primary reason we run on this patch is combat related: In patch 1.03 they introduced a lot of changes and updates to combat. Here are some of the notable differences for patch 1.03:
- In many fights, enemies moves less quickly at the start of combat.
- Enemies now gain more health as the game progresses.
- Lieutenant-rank enemies no longer lose more than 40% of their health from a single hit, and boss-rank enemies cannot lose more than 20%.
- Cleave talent now increases damage by 75% instead of 100%, while the cost has been increased from 20 stamina to 30 and cooldown from 20s to 25s.
