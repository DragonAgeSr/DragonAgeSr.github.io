## Keybindings

There are several keybindings you should take advantage of. 

- __Select full party__ \
    _Default: Ctrl + A_ \
    _Recommended: X_ \
    Useful when you want full control of your party, for example when you do <Tooltip tooltip="Party Member Teleportation Glitch"> [PMT](/docs/da2/strats/party-member-teleportation)</Tooltip>.

- __Select party member__ \
    _Default: F1 to F4_ \
    _Recommended: Default_ \
    By default these are bound to the function keys 1-4. Most used are 1 and 2.

- __Quick Heal__ \
    _Default: -_ \
    _Recommended: A mouse button_ \

- __Quick Mana/Stamina__ \
    _Default: =_ \
    _Recommended: A mouse button_ \

- __Quickslots__ \
    _Default: 1 to 0_ \
    _Recommended: Personal taste, at least 8 buttons should be easily reachable_ \
    These are the buttons on your action bar. Personally I leave 1-4 intact, slot 5 is bound to a mouse key, and 6-9 are bound to other keys that are comfortable for my fingers to reach.

- __Move camera left and right__ \
    _Default: A and D_ \
    _Recommended: None_ \
    You should remove these bindings. Use your mouse for camera movement.

- __Move left and right__ \
    _Default: Q and E_ \
    _Recommended: A and D_ 

- __Target closest and attack__ \
    _Default: R_ \
    _Recommended: Default_ 

- __Character Menu__ \
    _Default: C_ \
    _Recommended: Default_ 
    
- __Inventory Menu__ \
    _Default: I_ \
    _Recommended: Default_ 
    
- __Abilities Menu__ \
    _Default: P_ \
    _Recommended: Default_ 

- __Pause__ \
    _Default: Space_ \
    _Recommended: Default_ 
    
- __Hold Position / Move Freely__ \
    _Default: H_ \
    _Recommended: V_ 
    
- __Quick Save/Load__ \
    _Default: F5 and F9 respectively_ \
    _Recommended: Default_ \
    Quick note regarding quick loads: In this game it doesn't load your last quick save, it loads your last save regardless of what type it is.
