# Without gear

Currently the only required things to kill in the Any% route is the Mythal dragon, and Corypheus Phase 1 and 2. Every other enemy we can either skip or deal with in other ways, and Corypheus Phase 3 we can kill without doing damage to him. If we can find a way to kill the Mythal dragon or deal with Corypheus Phase 1 and 2 without needing gear we could avoid a few minutes of duplication and gear gathering.
