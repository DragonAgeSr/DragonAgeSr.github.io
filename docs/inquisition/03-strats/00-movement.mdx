# Movement

## Charging Bull

Easiest way to gain speed, but not the fastest. Main Character is Warrior.

## Flask thingy mabob

REALLY fast way to move around, but slow to set up. Worth it for longer categories. Main Character is Rogue, needs specialization AND get Sera.

## Mounts

Isn't actually that much faster than normal running speed. However it is useful to scale steep paths.
