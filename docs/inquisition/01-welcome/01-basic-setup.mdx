## Patches

The standard any% run for Dragon Age: Inquisition actually swap patches mid run!

:::caution TODO
- Talk about downpatching.
- Talk about how you swap patches mid run.
- Recommend using Origin over EA App.
    - Explain why
- Which schematics you need for Any% (This could maybe be in each of the run sections?)
