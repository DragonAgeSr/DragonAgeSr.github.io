# Altar of Mythal

- Quicksave just before fight.
- After cutscene, switch to Varric, use Stealth to lose aggro from the boss, Evade to get a little bit closer, use Full Draw and do the Hail of Arrows glitch (Where you use Hail of Arrows but you donâ€™t use Focus), Hook and Tackle to get close to the dragon and spam Leaping Shot. The Dragon should be dead in a matter of seconds.
- Right click the world map transition to go straight to Skyhold instead of the World map.
