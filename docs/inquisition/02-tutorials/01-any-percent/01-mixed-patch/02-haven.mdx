- Unlock Hinterlands. Don’t travel.
- War table - Pick up Hard in Hightown. Use Leliana and change system time to complete it now or use Josephine to complete it later. I do Josephine.
- Travel to World Map Transition. Whenever you do Charging Bull pay attention to your energy levels and jump when it’s about to expire, to preserve as much of your speed as possible. Pay attention to if the inquisitor auto-disengages from the combat stance or not. If you do, quick save, quit out to menu and go back in.
- Do WMG. When selecting Crestwood before it fully loads in you sometimes won’t be able to travel, safest to wait until fully loaded. Travel there. You can pick up the whole party, it’ll save some time as you don’t have to go through the confirmation of “are you sure, you don’t have a full party” situation.
