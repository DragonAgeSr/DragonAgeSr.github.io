# Temple of Mythal

- Jump to the platform, complete puzzle after cutscene.
- Charging bull up the stairs and jump over the fence
- In the next room, kill all the enemies. Best strat I have is using Hook and Tackle to get close to the enemy and then Leaping shot, rinse and repeat until everything is dead.
- Quick save, use fallback plan and jump down the hole. Use fallback plan to teleport back up.
    - There is an alternative strat here, I’ve never used it in runs, but you can jump in and pause the game at the right time, where you’re deep enough that the quest progresses, but you’re not close enough to the ground, qs/ql.
- Qs/ql, use fallback plan and switchclip oob with Varric. Evade off ledge, t-cam teleport inbounds again on middle of staircase, where the trigger is, fallback plan teleport back and click door.
    - Alternative old strat: Use inquisitor to go back to the door, switchclip through the sidewall. Charging bull if off CD down to staircase, t-cam teleport inbounds with trigger, run back up to door and click.
- After cutscenes, use Varric and run up to the top left corner, and switchclip up to the balcony. (Reminder, pause before t-cam is smart)
Once at the balcony, spam quicksave until you see the loading symbol in the bottom right (then you’re out of combat), and quickload. This makes the upcoming switchclip way more reliable.
Using Varric, jump up on the fence, face diagonally into the room, use Evade off the ledge and the moment Varric becomes visible pause the game. (If you’re too fast and pause before he’s visible he’ll just teleport back to the balcony). Enter tactical mode, and begin switchclipping. It’s very important that you pause and THEN enter tactical mode here. You’ll see Varric goes very fast, and the moment you go up too far you get pushed out of Tactical mode, but Varric still goes backwards. The goal is to get into this room, but sometimes you’ll be too high up, which isn’t an issue, just use the T cam to get back into the room.
    - Alternative old strat: Using Inquisitor, run through the door on the left. Use Charging bull in the enemy sections.
- Next up is Samson fight. Using Varric, place down Fallback plan before this door, around this location.
Use Evade 1 time, then use Evade off the staircase like this, and you’ll fly off. Get into the cutscene, skip through it fast, sometimes you get switched to the Inquisitor and have to switch back to Varric, cast Explosive shot and use Fallback plan to teleport back. Ideally you don’t get stunned, but sometimes it happens. Evade to the door, and you enter another cutscene. Very important that you skip through this fast or else you can die as the mobs are still there.
Make the Inquisitor drink from the well, so just spam 3.
- Once you’re back in Skyhold, travel back to the altar of Mythal asap. Only bring Varric.
