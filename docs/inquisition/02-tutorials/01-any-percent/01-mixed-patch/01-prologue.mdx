# Prologue

- Qs/ql on the first Cassandra cutscene. Saves about 1 second, easy to achieve (not doable on current patch)
- Jump off the bridge
- First fight: Attack 3 times, Crushing Blow, keep attacking until dead.
- Use the search function to cancel your auto-attack animations, you want to avoid the 3rd auto-attack as it’s just not worth it.
- Do a bit of research on Level Up fight?? Explain who to attack first etc, jump with cassandra/varric
- Charge with soldiers (spam space + 3)
- After fade in, use F1 to switch to inquisitor, move forward, get out of combat (if applicable), jump and press P to enter the level up/attribute screen. Use scroll wheel to scroll to the last page before it fully loads in and select Charging Bull and Cutting Words. 
- Charge towards next area.
- Skip these first enemies, they don’t matter. Focus the ranged dudes and then take down the other demons.
- Charge through enemies that spawn to knock them down instantly. Cutting words to deal more damage. If they try and teleport interrupt them with Crushing Blow.
- Temple of Sacred Ashes: Jump down to reach pride demon faster.
- After cutscene, move camera to the right as it auto-pans you to the left (on old patch at least), and immediately disturb the rift when it’s available. Charge in to the demon, use war cry as much as possible while vulnerable and cycle through your abilities.
- When demon is invulnerable, kill the demons that spawn and disturb the rift.
