# Doom Upon all the World

- Once back in Skyhold, start Doom Upon All the World from the war table. Only bring Varric.
- Cory Phase 1:
Switch to Varric, target Cory and cast Full Draw, and then do the Hail of Arrows glitch. (Glitch is a bit harder to get here, not a big deal if you don’t get it, just keep going.)
Evade forward, and hook up to Cory then spam Leaping shot.
Alternative strat: Evade and hook up to Cory, get behind him and spam Leaping shot. This is a good spot, but I’ve found they’re more unreliable for me than the previous strat.
- Cory Phase 2:
Hook up to the Dragon, use Hail of Arrows and spam Leaping Shot. (If you don’t have focus that’s fine, just spam leaping shot) until its dead.
- Cory Phase 3:
Using the Inquisitor, switch to Varric when almost at the top of the bend.
As Varric, place down Fallback Plan here, and walk the rest of the way up. At the top, stand on the ledge, look towards Cory and use Evade off the edge. Begin using your autoattack. If Cory aggroes on you the timing is 3 shots and then teleport, that should make Cory “yeet” after you and off the edge of the Arena, making him die to fall damage.
    - Alternatively, if he doesn’t aggro immediately, get up close to him and try and feel-time the fallback plan. If you’re lucky it works and he yeets after you
    - If he doesn’t immediately aggro at all, just leaping shot spam until he dies.
    - If you fail the fallback plan strat, get up on this edge and wait for him to attack you so he falls off the edge.
